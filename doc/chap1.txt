  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YWhat does the [5XPackageManager[105X[101X[1X package do?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  package  provides  the  ability to install or remove a package using a
  single  command:  [2XInstallPackage[102X  ([14X2.1-1[114X) or [2XRemovePackage[102X ([14X2.2-1[114X). The user
  can  specify  a  package  to  install  using  its name, or using a URL to an
  archive,   a   repository,   or   a  [10XPackageInfo.g[110X  file.  When  installing,
  [5XPackageManager[105X also attempts to compile the package, build its documentation
  if necessary, and ensure that its dependencies are also installed.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YWhat does the [5XPackageManager[105X[101X[1X package not do?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAt  present,  [5XPackageManager[105X  is  fairly basic, without many of the advanced
  features available in package managers such as pip or apt. For instance, the
  user  cannot update all packages in one command. Removing a package will not
  remove  any  of  its  dependencies,  since we do not track how packages were
  installed.  When  a package is installed, no tests are run to ensure that it
  is compatible with the installed version of GAP. Any of these features might
  be  added  in  the future. Other feature requests can be posted on the issue
  tracker at [7Xhttps://github.com/gap-packages/PackageManager/issues[107X.[133X
