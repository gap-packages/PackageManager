##  Status information. Currently the following cases are recognized:
##    "accepted"      for successfully refereed packages
##    "submitted"     for packages submitted for the refereeing
##    "deposited"     for packages for which the GAP developers agreed
##                    to distribute them with the core GAP system
##    "dev"           for development versions of packages
##    "other"         for all other packages
